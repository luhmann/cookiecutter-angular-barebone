* `.editorconfig`
* `.nvmrc`
* `.gitignore`
* `package.json`
* Live Reload-Server
* Minimal folder structure
* Minimal test setup

## Quick Start

```bash
pip install cookiecutter
```

or if you do not want to setup a python stack:

```bash
brew install cookiecutter
```

Scaffold your project:

Could have been done with yeoman, but thats verbose
